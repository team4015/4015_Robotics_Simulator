# 4015 Robotics Simulator
This repository will hold the code for the FRC Robotics competition simulator.

### What is the goal? ###
The plan is to make a working robotics simulator that is reusable every year given that the map
is stiched together from models provided by first. Import your own robot and use it in multiplayer matches
in an accurately simulated FIRST environment.

It is still a big W.I.P and the completion goal is before Fall Fiesta 2019. 

## Libraries Used: ##
1. SteamVR - VR not supported yet, but planned in the future.
2. Bullet Physics - Not fully implemented in the graphics pipeline yet but will be used as the physics backend
3. LWJGL 3 - Lightweight Java Game Library is used to provide binding to many useful libraries
4. GLFW
5. GLEW
6. Assimp
7. JOML
